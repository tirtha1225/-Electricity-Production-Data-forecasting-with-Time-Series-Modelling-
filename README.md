# Electricity-Production Data forecasting with Time Series Modelling 

Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Electricity Production Data using  time series models like SARIMAX and Exponential Smoothing 🌡️📈  

Overview : 

This repository contains the code and analysis for time series forecasting of electric production data. The dataset spans from January 1985 to December 2017, capturing monthly electric production values. The primary goal is to model the data, identify trends and seasonality, and forecast future production values using various statistical methods.

Features :

Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the data to identify trends and seasonality.

Seasonal Decomposition: Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Exponential Smoothing: Fitting an Exponential Smoothing model to the data.

SARIMAX Modeling: Fitting and tuning SARIMAX models for accurate forecasting.

Forecasting: Predicting future electric production values and evaluating model performance.
